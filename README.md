### Hello! I'm Mireia, a Frontend Developer enthusiast! ðŸ‘‹

I was born and raised in Barcelona, grateful for the creativity and the foreigners I always encountered in the city. At the age of 26, I decided to move to Berlin, Germany, which offered me the opportunity to get to know a new language, culture, and city. I was fortunate to work in what was my passion at that time, the music industry. I collaborated in creative spaces, management, and support in record labels, working with great professionals from all over the world. They introduced me to SQL, HTML, and remote work, what already seemed to me as a vision is now what drives our generation.

Eventually, I decided to enroll in a Full Stack Development Bootcamp, which provided a professional change and, after 13 years, brought me back to Barcelona. Today, programming, my family, friends, the sun, and the sea are my happiness.
